\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have shown inapproximablity results for energy minimization in the general case and planar 3-label case. In addition, we present a unified overview of the complexity of existing energy minimization problems by arranging them in a fine-grained complexity scale. These altogether set up a new viewpoint for interpreting and classifying the complexity of optimization problems for the computer vision community.  In the future, it will be interesting to consider the open questions of the complexity of structure-, rank-, and expectation-approximation for energy minimization.
