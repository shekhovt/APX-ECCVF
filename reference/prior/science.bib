abstract = "One of the key computational problems in Bayesian networks is computing the maximal posterior probability of a set of variables in the network, given an observation of the values of another set of variables. In its most simple form, this problem is known as the MPE-problem. In this paper, we give an overview of the computational complexity of many problem variants, including enumeration variants, parameterized problems, and approximation strategies to the MPE-problem with and without additional (neither observed nor explained) variables. Many of these complexity results appear elsewhere in the literature; other results have not been published yet. The paper aims to provide a fairly exhaustive overview of both the known and new results. "
