   %Discrete energy minimization is an established work engine for performing inference in graphical models 
   Discrete energy minimization is a recognized optimization problem, used to solve MAP inference in graphical models and closely related to several well-known combinatorial optimization problems.
%<<<<<<< Updated upstream
   %In this paper we give a comprehensive overview of subclasses solvable in polynomial time as well as subclasses admitting a constant factor approximation. We further contribute to the study of complexity by showing that general energy minimization is exp-APX-complete, meaning it is as hard as any optimization problem with a polynomial-time computable objective function and whose arbitrary feasible solution can be found in polynomial time, and the general problem cannot be approximated with a better then exponential factor. The result holds already in case of two labels, \ie, for quadratic pseudo-Boolean optimization. Further, we show that planar problem with 3 labels is exp-APX-complete as well.
