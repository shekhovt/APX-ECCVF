 abstract = {This paper gives general conditions under which a collection of optimization problems, with the objective function and the constraint set depending on a parameter, has optimal solutions that are an isotone function of the parameter. Relating to this, we present a theory that explores and elaborates on the problem of minimizing a submodular function on a lattice.},
